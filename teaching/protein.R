### WEEK 8 FACTOR STUFF

food <- read.csv("protein.csv", row.names=1)
pcfood <- prcomp(food, scale=TRUE)
zfood <- predict(pcfood) 
## predict is just doing the same thing as the below:
z <- scale(food)%*%pcfood$rotation
all(z==zfood)

## implies rotations are on scale of standard deviations if scale=TRUE
## looks like PC1 is an 'average diet', PC2 is iberian
t( round(pcfood$rotation[,1:2],2) )

## do some k-means, for comparison
grpProtein <- kmeans(scale(food), centers=7, nstart=20)

## how do the PCs look?
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(zfood[,1:2], type="n", xlim=c(-4,5))
text(x=zfood[,1], y=zfood[,2], labels=rownames(food), col=rainbow(7)[grpProtein$cluster])
plot(zfood[,3:4], type="n", xlim=c(-3,3))
text(x=zfood[,3], y=zfood[,4], labels=rownames(food), col=rainbow(7)[grpProtein$cluster])

## how many do we need? tough to tell
plot(pcfood, main="")
mtext(side=1, "European Protein Principle Components",  line=1, font=2)

## summary puts these scree plots on a more intuitive scale: 
	## proportion of variation explained.
summary(pcfood)
